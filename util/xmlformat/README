A part of the xmlformat package from http://www.kitebird.com/software/xmlformat
which is unfortunately not in all important distributions.

Motivation: most xml formatters like xmllint support only block layout. That is
fine for data files, but Docbook has many elements which look inline nicer.

Requirements: The installed part requires Perl.
If you prefer Ruby, you can also install xmlformat.rb.

To reformat an existing file run from the top source dir:
util/xmlformat/xmlformat.pl -f util/xmlformat/xmlformat.conf -i xml-file

If you installed the package xmlformat you can shorten it to:
xmlformat -f util/xmlformat/xmlformat.conf -i xml-file

To reformat all files of the english guide:
for i in guide/C/*.xml; do util/xmlformat/xmlformat.pl -f util/xmlformat/xmlformat.conf -i $i ; done

There is also a {-b|--backup}[ suffix] option, but git reset HEAD is easier.

After changes of the docbook version, verify all elements are recognized with
--show-unconfigured-elements

configure.ac and xmldocs.make are fragments from a former approach to define a make target.
